Use this program to rebuild PRPC statements into SQL queries using the output from the PEGA Tracer.

You can do that in several ways:

- Using a text file with your PEGA Tracer output by simply providing the file name, like:
		java -jar RebuildPRPCStatements.jar file.txt

- Providing the PEGA Tracer output from command line interface
